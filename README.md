Welcome to my student account, which I use for Purdue classes and clubs.

My name's Vincent Vu and I'm currently a computer science student at Purdue University.

Currently, I develop for [**@Hack-the-Future**](https://github.com/Hack-the-Future) and [**@purdue-arc**](https://github.com/purdue-arc)
